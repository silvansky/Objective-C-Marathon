Objective-C Marathon
====================

Hello everybody! I'm a graphic designer from Moscow. I'm learning how to program in Objective-C.

## Goals of marathon

1. Learn Objective-C and iOS development step by step.
2. Create a new app every single day.
3. Deliver it in a form of simple yet smart idea.
4. Don't be afraid of anything.
5. Have fun.
