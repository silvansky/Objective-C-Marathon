Objective-C Marathon
====================

Hello everybody! I'm a graphic designer from Moscow. I'm learning how to program in Objective-C.

## Goals of marathon

1. Learn Objective-C and iOS development step by step.
2. Create a new app every single day.
3. Deliver it in a form of simple yet smart idea.
4. Don't be afraid of anything.
5. Have fun.


## Apps list

#### 1. Counter
*What I learned:* creating buttons and displays, connecting it to some actions in my viewController.

#### 2. Don't tap me!
*What I learned:* calculating random values, working with iOS typefaces, setting custom background color, handling single tap.

#### 3. Colored Circles
*What I learned:* creating custom view, drawing circles with drawRect, accessing tap coordinates, working with UIColor, executing code in viewDidload.

#### 4. De Stijl
*What I learned:* handling pan gesture, procedural drawing of De Stijl paining, storing CGPoint in @property.

#### 5. Where's Mona?
*What I learned:* handling device rotation, loading different images to UIView, disabling device rotation animations (except the very first one), turning on upsideDown device position.

#### 6. 50 (or 256 to be precise) Shades of Gray
*What I learned:* page-based application, categories, digging in some magic code.

#### 7. Inside iPhone
*What I learned:* how to make app without writing any line of code at all.

#### 8. Never Sorry
*What I learned:* how to compose picture and video input into augemented reality.

#### 9. Web Art

2. Concepts of protocols and delegations
3. Object oriented programming concepts in practice: A PIE (Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation)
4. How to store data between user sessions
5. UIGestureRecognizer and all possible gestures in iOS
6. Frame animation
